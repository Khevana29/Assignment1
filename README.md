# Getting Started with Create React App

  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  

The page will reload when you make changes.\

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `npm test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `npm run eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

  

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

  

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Instructions

### Technologies

Server: None  
Client: JavaScript/React JS  
Database: None

Create a shopping website with the following features:

1. A page that displays the 5 or more products (images and descriptions) that may be purchased in various quantities. This, and/or an optional product details page, should allow the user to select a quantity for purchase.

2. A shopping cart page that shows the selected items and quantities of each user. This page should optionally allow the user to change quantities or remove items from the cart. This page should also allow the user to finalize their purchase.

3. An account creation/editing page where the user can create a new account or modify current details. This page should at least collect/update the user's shipping address. Other optional behavior could include password change. Optionally, account creation should be at the discretion of the user, so they may purchase anonymously.

4. A comments page where purchasers with accounts may rate and comment on products they have purchased with their account. They may optionally upload photos as well as enter comment text. This page should also display comments from others to the current user before and after the purchase.

5. A login element on every page that shows the user a login dialog for switching from anonymous shopping. The element should optionally switch to showing the user's name when logged in.

Data will be hardcoded, as demonstrated in class, in a way that can easily be replaced by data provided by server-side APIs in subsequent assignments.

The pages could optionally include animated elements to enhance the appearance of the page.

## Marks

A completely working and visually attractive project with none of the elements marked optional implemented will receive a mark of 54%. Proper use of Git and Azure DevOps is worth an additional 15%. The seven optional elements indicated above are each worth an additional 3% if implemented successfully. If the project contains an element that is not listed here, it will be considered for up to an additional 3% as well. You must indicate the nature of the element in accompanying documentation. Also note that 100% is the maximum grade available.

To best demonstrate your project in action, please create a short video of your application, demonstrating all the required and optional elements you have completed. The submission of a video is worth up to 10%.

If you do not contribute to the project as evidenced by Git repository commits, your mark will be reduced from the group's mark.
